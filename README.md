# setupscripts

Just a repository of scripts used to setup my computers. Currently a very early WIP since it only really works with Ubuntu distros and only installs docker and go

## Instructions
```
# 1. Clone Repo
git clone https://github.com/weakmint/setupscripts.git && cd setupscripts

# 2. Edit Variables to match your desired variables
nano variables.sh

# 3. Run setup.sh
./setup.sh
